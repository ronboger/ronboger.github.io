What if the most creative minds channeled their focus into solving the most impactful problems of today? Imagine if we could apply the ingenuity that powers the most profound technology into the most fundamental of all human concerns: health. MedHacks is the start.
                                   
At MedHacks 2015, we're selecting the top innovative technologists, scientists, medical professionals, and engineers to build amazing things together. Hackers across all disciplines will unite to meet with the experts in every part of the medical field here at Johns Hopkins to develop their solutions to healthcare problems across the globe. At the end of the event, teams will have the opportunity to present their projects. Winners will be chosen by a board of judges.

## Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/colorize/house_color.jpg" alt="Colorizing"/>

Worked with a classmate in Computer Vision course to colorize Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskiiâ€™s black and white images of the Russian empire. Gorskii took 3 shots of each scene - one with a Blue filter in front of the camera, one with a Green filter, and one with a Red filter. Our solution used SIFT descriptors to define homographies between the 3 sub-images and merge them together in mosaic-like fashion.

Technologies used: MATLAB

## Dash

Placing as the top JHU team and 3rd overall at Hophacks Spring 2015, Dash is an incentive based fitness app that allows users to competitively race their friends. Users can schedule their races within the Dash interface, which allows them to set an endpoint and the amount each competitor must wager to enter the race. It's simple: first person to reach the end marker wins the prize. We wanted to revolutionize the way people think about fitness, and Dash provides motivation and childlike wonder to running again. Along with being a primary developer on the project, I designed the entire UI/UX.
