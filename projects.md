## Sparse Subspace Clustering with Missing Entries

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/ssc_missing_entries.png" alt="SSC"/>

My MS project focused on Sparse Subspace Clustering with missing entries, particularly on developing new algorithms to be able to cluster and complete high-dimensional data with missing entries. Our work was published in ICCV 2019 as [Classifying and Comparing Approaches to Subspace Clustering with Missing Data](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/RSL-CV/Lane_Classifying_and_Comparing_Approaches_to_Subspace_Clustering_with_Missing_Data_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf).

## Piano Performance

I've been playing the piano since I was 8 years old. I have performed in hospitals and senior homes in San Francisco and Baltimore. From 2016-2017, I did a piano performance minor at the Peabody Conservatory at the Johns Hopkins University. 

<!-- I learned and performed:
- Chopin Etude Op. 10 No. 5
- Beethoven Sonata No. 18
- Debussy Prelude No. 5 Book 1: Les Collines d'Ancapri
- Bach French Suite No. 5 -->

Video recording of one of my performances during Spring 2017:

A rehearsal playing Chopin Etude Op. 10 No. 5 in Fall 2016:

<!-- In 2013, I produced a video recording of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Now I think it feels a bit rushed and amateurish, but still believe it's enjoyable.

## MedHacks

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/medhacks.jpg" alt="MedHacks"/>

<!-- What if the most creative minds channeled their focus into solving the most impactful problems of today? Imagine if we could apply the ingenuity that powers the most profound technology into the most fundamental of all human concerns: health. MedHacks is the start. -->
                                   
I founded and led <a href="http://medhacks.org">MedHacks</a>, an international medical hackathon to promote collaboration and innovation in medicine and engineering. The first MedHacks attracted over 400 participants from 25 universities and 3 countries to hack health on Oct 2-4, 2015. Still growing, MedHacks has established itself as one of the largest and most well-known medical hackatons, formed deep relationships with industry and academia, and led to the formation of numerous venture funded startups in healthcare and biotechnology.

## Hackathons

### StrollSafe

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/strollsafe_2.jpeg" alt="strollsafe"/>

Winning the Comcast EveryBlock API prize at PennApps, StrollSafe is an app all about contextual maps. Strollsafe releases location-based crime reports for people out walking. Using OpenDataPhilly and EveryBlock info, the app overlays crime data onto a standard map. 

Check out our submission on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/strollsafe">Devpost</a> and our <a href="http://technical.ly/baltimore/2015/09/09/heres-project-jhu-students-took-home-top-prize-pennapps/">press</a>.

### Dash

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/dash_2.jpeg" alt="Dash"/>

Placing 3rd overall at Hophacks Spring 2015, Dash is an incentive based fitness app that allows users to competitively race their friends. Users can schedule their races within the Dash interface, which allows them to set an endpoint and the amount each competitor must wager to enter the race. It's simple: first person to reach the end marker wins the prize. We wanted to revolutionize the way people think about fitness, and Dash provides motivation and childlike wonder to running again. 
Check out our submission on <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/dash-3nb0n">DevPost</a> and our presentation on <a href="http://youtu.be/gSPnXP_eHsE?t=1h8m45s">YouTube</a>.

<!-- ## Flapp

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/flapp.png" alt="flapp"/>

As part of my Biomedical Engineering Design Team, I cofounded <a href="http://dt5.github.io/">flapp</a>, a mobile application for 3D local soft-tissue flap Design for facial reconstructive surgery. Flapp established collaborations with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design. Further, we won several honors and grants: Finalist for JHU Business Plan Competition, inHealth Shark Tank, and the Dr. Andrew Malinow Bridge Funding Award.

## Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection

<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="../assets/images/projects/colorize/house_color.jpg" alt="Colorizing"/>

Worked with a classmate in Computer Vision course to colorize Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskiiâ€™s black and white images of the Russian empire. Gorskii took 3 shots of each scene - one with a Blue filter in front of the camera, one with a Green filter, and one with a Red filter. Our solution used SIFT descriptors to define homographies between the 3 sub-images and merge them together in mosaic-like fashion.

Further information (code, images, and report) available on <a href="https://github.com/ronboger/computer-vision-3-image-colorize">Github.</a>
