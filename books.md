Below is a collection of notes on some books I've read - I began to heavily annotate books sometime during summer of 2017. I have a strong preference for reading fiction, but rarely take notes on them. Short summary but detailed notes for each. This page will constantly update as I read more.

## Favorites

- Siddhartha, Demian - Herman Hesse
- The Alchemist - 
- The Power of Now - 
- Meditations - Marcus Aurelius
- Brave New World - Aldous Huxley

## Book notes
