tl;dr: After almost 10 months of personal exploration and nonstop travel, I‚Äôm off to a new adventure.


When I left Mapme, I had no idea what my next move would be. The years prior had always been about taking the best opportunities and going full steam ahead. The second I finished high school I did exactly that. I joined an accelerator, worked at a startup, served in an intelligence division in the Israeli military, spent some time at a VC firm, launched side projects with friends, organized meetups and spent years working on Mapme. One thing always led to the next.

For the first time in my life I asked myself questions I‚Äôd never thought about before. Where should I be? What should I do? What are my goals? Everything was up in the air, and the space of parameters dramatically increased.

Like every Israeli 22 year old, I bought a ticket to somewhere far away with no real plan. I landed in Bangkok and spent months traveling between Chiang Mai, Pai, Hanoi, Sapa, Hoi An, De Nang and Shanghai. I went hiking and motorbiking with hostel friends from Germany, Canada and Australia. I ran into former colleagues from the military in Vietnamese rice fields and Thai villages. I tried my best to disconnect.

After moving around Asia for a few months and getting very sick twice, I decided to switch continents. At the start of my trip I had this idea that I‚Äôd figure out my life while traveling, but honestly, I finished with even more unanswered questions.

August: Went to Montreal to Montreal Language Fest with one of my best friends from school
September: Booked one way flight to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Couchsurfed for the first time.
October: Meditation retreat
November: Learned the meaning of beauty in the Patagonia.
December: Flown back for YC.
January: Started learning Portuguese and meeting the Brazilian community.
February: Turned down a round for company
March: Longevity stuff
April: Edwin stuff
May: Marked with confusion, searching for an apartment in SF, crashing on couches.


Part of me still doesn't love it here. It's cold. It's expensive. Everything closes early. Only founders and VCs get worship.

I went back to Tel Aviv to grapple some more with my questions. I wasn‚Äôt ready to stay put yet, so over the following months I spent time going back and forth from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Manhattan, Zurich and St. Gallen.

With time on my hands, I read books that had been on my list, like Sapiens, Ready Player One, Shoe Dog and The Name of the Wind. I tried new things like yoga and meditation. I caught up with old friends.

While in Israel I reached out to Erik Torenberg about organizing On Deckdinners in Tel Aviv with Raphael Ouzan. Raphael and I were inundated with hundreds of applications. We kept the initial batch small and received fantastic feedback. The concept was simple: three hours of intimate chatting for anyone who was thinking about what was next career wise.

Coming back to San Francisco, I wanted to maintain the mindset of the traveler, of one who has the beginners mind. I began study of Portuguese.

Side note: two of the first attendees became cofounders and recently closed a seed round for their new company üôè
What I loved most about these dinners was that everyone, no matter their background, was at some sort of crossroads in their life. Whether it was a successful founder seeking a challenge, a VP Product thinking about a move or a developer debating between joining a company and building projects. After these events, I spent countless hours meeting one on one with all kinds of folks talking about this decision process.

I left every conversation with two main takeaways: maximize learning and work with the best people possible.

I raised money for a company to do phenotypic screens for glioblastomas, and turned it down. In March, I became fast friends with Laura Deming and have been doing projects with the [Longevity Fund](https://longevity.vc) and helping with the formation of [Age 1](https://age1.com). In April-May, I worked with my friends at [Edwin.ai](https://edwin.ai) making conversational chatbots for language learning. 


I spent weeks looking for relevant opportunities where I could maximize both. One of my main criteria was finding experienced founders who had a better sense of what they were doing the second, third or fourth time around. After a fair share of meetings, emails and calls with multiple companies, I found a great fit.

I‚Äôm thrilled to be leading growth at [System1](https://system1.bio), an early stage biotechnology startup based in San Francisco. System1 is on a mission to solve the way teams share knowledge and support each other. In essence we‚Äôre taking the traditional service desk model and rebuilding it from scratch in a much simpler and smarter way.

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish on System1:

- Team is top notch and worked together in the past.
- Investors are top tier and in for the long run.
- The market is ripe for change and the vision is huge.
- The culture heavily focuses on collaboration between bio and software, and I get to hang out with the biology team.
- They think long term. Prior to the recent formation of the ML team, there was a strong software team that built a solid infrastrcuture so that ML can focus on modeling and biology.
- Unlike most other computational drug discovery companies, System1 is actually running experiments. 
- They're in stealth, which means I can avoid talking about my work in social situations (something people love to do in the city).


I‚Äôll still be dreaming up side projects, helping companies launch on Product Hunt and organizing On Deck dinners in Tel Aviv, but my top priority will be doing everything I can for Spoke to grow. And I‚Äôm always available if you want to reach out.

Thank you to everyone who helped me throughout this past year. I appreciate it more than you know.
