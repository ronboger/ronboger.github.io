title: How I became fluent in Spanish in < 3 months
published: false

Two years ago, I spent my winter break living in Kibbutz Neot Semedar, a [kibbutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz) in the Negev of Israel. One day I was tasked to design the electrical circuits with Dan, an Israel-Argentinian 22 year engineer who recently finished his military service. In that day, something clicked. I took Spanish courses years ago, but treated it as a class rather than a language and never understood a thing. Dan had started teaching me Spanish from the perspective of a Hebrew speaker. In that one day, I learned more Spanish than I did in 4 years of courses, and developed a theory on language. These last two months I've been living/traveling in Argentina, and successfully tested this theory.

To preface, there are of course different levels of fluency. As it turns out, every Spanish speaking country has their own dialect. I speak Argentinian Spanish, due to my travels in Argentina and enamoration with Argentinian culture. I still have a ton to learn, and sometimes words just don't come out for me. Regardless, to provide perspective on where my level of fluency is:
- Most who come from outside of Latin America tend to perceive me as a local.
- Argentinians tend to think I'm European, usually someone from France/Brazil who learned Spanish with ease, or someone from another part of Europe who has Argentinian parents. I've met several English teachers in Argentina, who all found it easier to communicate with me in Spanish than in English.
- The other day, I met two Chileans and hung out with them for a while. An hour in to our encounter, an Australian came and asked us a few questions in English. I answered, and was then complimented by two Chileans on how well I speak English, as they were convinced I was from Buenos Aires.

Obviously, there's room for growth here. Nonetheless, I think and speak in Spanish effortlessly, and the method to do so is what I hope to distill in this post.

## What I did

- Watch Naruto in Spanish
- Language exchange with Lawrence
- Listen to a lot of music in Spanish
- Try to talk to everyone in Argentina (works best in non-touristy areas)

## For monolingual speakers

- Build a base as fast as possible. 
- Afterwards, don't translate.
- Be super interested in the cutlure. This can't be overstated.
- On this note, listen to music in the language. You'll get the accent better, etc. Spanish has a ton of different music, from cumbia to reggaeton to bachata to salsa.


## Additions for bilingual speakers

I grew up in a Hebrew speaking household in the US.

tengo ganas =
ya = כבר
In English, the concept of "ya" is a bit complicated to explain. Take these three sentences as an example:
- Ya fui al supermercado - I already went to the supermarket.
- [Ya no sé que hacer conmigo]() - I don't know what to do with myself anymore. (This is also the name great song by Uruguayan band Cuarteto de nos)
- Ya vuelvo - I return soon.

Translating these directly into English causes immediate problems. In the first sentence, "ya" means "already"; in the second, "ya" means "anymore"; in the third, "ya" means "soon". In Hebrew, on the contrary, "ya" is exactly the word "כבר" in all contexts.
