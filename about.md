Hey there! My name is Ron. 

<!-- I don't identify as being anything, but am most frequently identified by others as a scientist, engineer, polyglot, artist, and entrepreneur. -->

I'm a Biophysics PhD student at UC Berkeley in [Jennifer Doudna's lab](https://doudnalab.org/). I'm also a Venture Partner at [Compound VC](https://www.compound.vc/), investing in frontier tech, and advise a few companies in this area too. 

In the past, I worked as a Tech Lead on ML/Bio problems at [GoogleX](https://x.company), a machine learning scientist at [Herophilus (prev. System1 Biosciences)](https://www.herophilus.com/), a researcher in the [VisionLab](http://vision.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University. 

<!-- I've also researched alternative protein production with [Convergent Research](https://www.convergentresearch.org/). -->

I completed my Master's studies in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu) in May 2017, where I concurrently did my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics. While I was in college, I founded and directed [MedHacks](http://medhacks.org) and was a [KPCB Fellow](http://kpcbfellows.com) in 2016. I also had a wonderful time as a piano performance student at the Peabody Conservatory while at Johns Hopkins. 

I was born in the beautiful city of Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. I've also spent some time in San Francisco, Kauai, Lisbon, Buenos Aires, and Neot Semedar. I love languages - at one point I spoke fluent English, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, although probably rusty on the last two.
