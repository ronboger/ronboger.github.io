<!-- ## What Iâ€™m doing now -->

I'm traveling and working on a few projects. The general direction of my travels is east; one might call this "the long way" back to California. I'm especially looking to meet introspective, curious, and kind people on my journey. If you know or are one of these, reach out at ronnyb - at - jhu - dot - edu.

Among these projects is an expansion of the machine learning research I was doing for my Masters during my time at JHU. More on this can be found via my [projects](../projects) page.

Projects aside, I spend a good portion of my time reading, playing music, running, and thinking about the most important problems to take on next. I take notes on and glean lessons from much of what I read, so perhaps I'll post these too on the site in the future.
