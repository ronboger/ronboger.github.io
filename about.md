Hey there! My name is Ron Boger. I currently work as a Tech Lead at [X](https://x.company), Google's moonshot laboratory. I don't identify as being anything, but am most frequently identified by others as a scientist, engineer, polyglot, artist, and entrepreneur.

In the past, I was a machine learning scientist at [System1 Biosciences](https://system1.bio), the founder and director of [MedHacks](http://medhacks.org), a researcher in the [VisionLab](http://vision.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, a machine learning engineer at [Flipboard](http://about.flipboard.com), a [KPCB Fellow](http://kpcbfellows.com), a piano performance student at the Peabody Conservatory, among other things.

I completed my Master's studies in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu) in May 2017, where I also concurrently did my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics.

I was born in the beautiful city of Tel Aviv, Israel, and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. I've also lived in San Francisco, Buenos Aires, San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina), and Neot Semedar (Israel) - this list will grow over time. I love languages, and speak fluent English, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, and French - this list will also grow over time.

<!-- On the side, I'm really interested in the below areas - if they're things you like to chat about, drop me a line! -->

<!-- ## Timeline, for context: -->
<!-- - 1995: Born in Tel Aviv, Israel. -->
<!-- - 1998: First moved to Baltimore, MD. -->

<!-- - 2003: Started playing the piano, received first lesson as my 8th birthday present. -->
<!-- - 2004: Last of Israeli friends in my neighborhood in Baltimore returned to Israel.  -->
<!-- - 2007: Expanded musical ability to guitar and singing. -->
<!-- - 2009: In high school, worked as a neuroscience researcher at the Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Realized I wanted to combine sciences and technology to try to make change at the worldwide level. Previously wanted to be a neurosurgeon.
- 2012: Taught myself chess, reached 1500 rating within 3 months, won a few tournaments.
- 2013: Accepted offer of admission to the Biomedical Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University, chosen over returning to Israel to join the army. Graduated as valedictorian of high school (for whatever that's worth...), started freshman year at JHU. Became a US citizen.
- 2014: Wanted to drop out of JHU, ended up taking 2x a regular course load. Went to CES and took an interest in computer science and programming computers. Decided to start MedHacks and started to learn to lead. Took first graduate level course, in computer vision.
- 2015: Made it to the crazy world of Silicon Valley. Pulled off the first MedHacks. Accepted into Masters program for Computer Science at JHU. Did lots of musical theater.  -->
<!-- On the darker side, was fired as a RA mid-semester and lived on couches of friends, effectively homeless, for the remainder of the year. -->
<!-- - 2016: Lived on Kibbutz Neot Semedar for a month. Started reading voraciously. Began MS program in Computer Science, and later research in the Vision and Learning Lab at JHU. Returned to San Francisco as a KPCB Fellow. Accepted to piano study at Peabody Conservatory.
- 2017: Graduated MS and BS in May 2017. Began practicing Vipassana meditation seriously. Lived a good portion of the year in Argentina, became fluent in Argentinian Spanish.  -->
