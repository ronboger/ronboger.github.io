## What Iâ€™m doing now

I'm in the first year of my PhD in [Biophysics at UC Berkeley](https://biophysics.berkeley.edu/), working in [Jennifer Doudna's](https://doudnalab.org/) lab. Within lab, I'm broadly interested in topics at the intersection of computation, physics, and biotechnology. 

More generally, it's been a time of a lot of positive change, which isn't always easy. I feel settled in Berkeley after bouncing around the entire pandemic. 

I'm always looking to meet introspective, curious, and kind people on my journey. If you know or are one of these, reach out at ronb - at - berkeley - dot - edu.
