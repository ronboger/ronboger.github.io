Hey there! My name is Ron Boger. Currently I'm a researcher in the [VisionLab](http://vision.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses primarily on methods for unsupervised machine learning, particularly at the intersection of subspace clustering and compressed sensing. I completed my Master's studies in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University in May 2017, where I also concurrently did my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics. 

<!-- My research interests include non-convex optimization, sparsity, compressed sensing, deep learning, subspace clustering -->

In the past, I was a founder of [MedHacks](http://medhacks.org), a machine learning engineer at [Flipboard](http://about.flipboard.com), a [KPCB Fellow](http://kpcbfellows.com), a piano minor student at the Peabody Conservatory, among other things.
