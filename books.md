Below is a collection of notes on some books I've read and a list of my favorites. I began to heavily annotate books sometime during summer of 2017. 

I have a strong preference for reading fiction. I see myself in a creative, generative, and artistic light, and therefore see more value in reading creative, generative, and artistic stories. Having said this, I rarely take notes on fiction. 

Short summary but detailed notes for each. Think of this as an online [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). This page will constantly update as I read more.

## Book notes

Currently, no notes are posted. Stay tuned :)

## Favorites

### All time

Criteria for non-fiction to be a favorite: must be incredibly thought provoking and perhaps change how I view a core belief. For fiction: must cover non-fiction criteria and provoke significant emotion. My favorites, under this criteria, are as follows:

- [Siddhartha](http://amzn.to/2eNQyxw), [Demian](http://amzn.to/2gTqchR) - Herman Hesse. His other books are great too, but progressively more weird.
- [The Alchemist](http://amzn.to/2jdYRHW) - Paulo Coelho
- [The Power of Now](http://amzn.to/2gTmOUq) - Eckhart Tolle
- [Meditations](http://amzn.to/2wPJpaL) - Marcus Aurelius
- [Brave New World](http://amzn.to/2gT1NFp) - Aldous Huxley

Many other books I've read are quite good. My rating for them can be found on my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69825193-ron-boger).
