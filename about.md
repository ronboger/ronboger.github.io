Hey there! My name is Ron Boger. Currently I'm a master's student in Computer Science in the [VisionLab](http://vision.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, where I also did my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics. The focus of my research is unsupervised machine learning, particularly on sparse subspace clustering with missing entries.

In the past, I was a founder of [MedHacks](http://medhacks.org), a machine learning engineer at [Flipboard](http://about.flipboard.com), a [KPCB Fellow](http://kpcbfellows.com), a piano minor student at the Peabody Conservatory, among other things. 

More about me via my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ronboger) and my [Github](https://github.com/ronnyb29/). Feel free to contact me at ronnyb - at - jhu - dot - edu.
